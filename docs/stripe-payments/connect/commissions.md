![Index Commissions](https://enupal.com/assets/docs/enupal-stripe-connect-9.png)
 
## Pending Commissions

Pending commissions are created if the Vendor has `paymentType` as `Manually` or if during checkout a Stripe error comes up (the most common error is `balance_insufficient` The transfer or payout could not be completed because the associated account does not have a sufficient balance available)

You can Pay manually the Commission, editing a commission and clicking the `Pay` button next to the total

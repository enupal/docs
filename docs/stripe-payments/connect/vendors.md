# Vendors

A vendor is associated to a Craft CMS user and each vendor will be associated to a Stripe account. 

## How to create a vendor?

Vendors can be created from two ways:

1.- From the CP. under Stripe Payments â†’ Vendors on the index page click on "Create Vendor"

2.- Create vendors on user activation, specifying a lightswitch user field or a user group on the Connect settings, here the vendors will be created as disabled and when the vendor connect their Stripe Account the vendor will be enabled.

## How to associate a Stripe Account to a vendor?

This needs to be done via the front-end, each vendor needs to be logged in with their Craft User.
Please take as an example our marketplace templates (link above), in the Front-end a logged in vendor could go to `/marketplace/account` the vendor needs to click on the `Connect with Stripe` button and will be redirected to the Stripe Onboard process and finally will be redirected with a valid Stripe Id that will be associated to the vendor.

# Creating Coupons

All coupons should be created on your Stripe Dashboard. Coupon codes added in your Stripe dashboard will be displayed on your Craft CMS dashboard: **Stripe Payments** → **Coupons**. Stripe allows percentage or amount off discounts.  
  
To add a coupon go to **Billing** → **Coupons** on your stripe dashboard, click the New button at the top right and add the Name and the ID.

The **ID** is the **coupon code** and is what the customer will have to enter exactly to apply the coupon to their payment(s) or subscription.  

Next, you can specify a **Percentage** or **Fixed amount** discount type and value.
